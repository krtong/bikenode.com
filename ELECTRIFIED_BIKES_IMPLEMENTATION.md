# Electrified Bikes Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added "Electrified" as a third bike type option in the add-bike-v2 system, alongside Motorcycles and Bicycles. This category is designed for electric bikes that don't fit traditional categories - particularly high-power e-bikes, e-mopeds, and off-road electric bikes like Sur-Ron and Talaria.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Updates

#### add-bike-v2.njk
- Added third type card for "Electrified" with lightning bolt icon (âš¡)
- Shows example brands: Sur-Ron, Talaria, Super73, E-Mopeds
- Includes count display for electrified models

#### JavaScript Updates (add-bike-v2/js/)
- **app.js**: 
  - Updated type selection to handle 'electrified' type
  - Added electrified count loading from API
  - Updated breadcrumb navigation for electrified bikes

- **api.js**:
  - Added API endpoints for electrified bikes
  - Updated all data loading functions (brands, years, models, variants, specs)
  - Added proper data normalization for electrified responses

- **views.js**:
  - Added lightning bolt SVG icon for electrified brands and specs display
  - Added specialized specification categories for electrified bikes:
    - Power System (motor power, battery, charging)
    - Performance (top speed, range, modes)
    - Chassis (frame, suspension)
    - Features (display, lights)

#### CSS Updates
- Modified grid layout to accommodate 3 type cards
- Adjusted max-width from 800px to 1000px
- Reduced min-width per card from 300px to 280px

### 2. Backend Updates (main.go)

#### API Endpoints Added
- `/api/electrified/brands` - Get list of electrified bike brands
- `/api/electrified/years/{brand}` - Get available years for a brand
- `/api/electrified/models/{brand}/{year}` - Get models for brand/year
- `/api/electrified/variants/{brand}/{year}/{model}` - Get model variants
- `/api/electrified/specs/{brand}/{year}/{model}` - Get specifications

#### Health Check
- Updated to include electrified bike count from database
- Gracefully handles missing table (returns 0 count)

#### Handler Functions
- `getElectrifiedBrands()` - Returns list of 23 electrified brands with counts
- `getElectrifiedYears()` - Returns years 2020-2025 (demo data)
- `getElectrifiedModels()` - Returns brand-specific models
- `getElectrifiedVariants()` - Returns model variants
- `getElectrifiedSpecs()` - Returns detailed specifications

### 3. Database Structure

#### Migration Files Created
- `000004_create_electrified_table.up.sql`
- `000004_create_electrified_table.down.sql`

#### Tables Created

**electrified_data**
- Stores individual electrified bike models
- Fields for power specs (motor, battery, performance)
- Physical specs (weight, frame, components)
- Pricing and metadata
- Unique constraint on (brand, model, year, variant)

**electrified_brands**
- Stores brand information
- Categories array for brand specializations
- Country, website, logo URL
- Pre-populated with 23 brands

#### Sample Data
- 8 demo bikes inserted (Sur-Ron, Talaria, Super73, Onyx, Segway models)
- Real-world specifications and pricing

## Electrified Bike Categories

### Off-Road Electric
- Sur-Ron, Talaria, Segway, Stealth
- High power (3000W-8000W+)
- Not street legal, off-road only

### E-Mopeds
- Super73, Onyx, Ariel Rider, Juiced Bikes
- Moped styling with pedals
- 750W-3000W range
- Urban/lifestyle focused

### High-Power E-Bikes
- Biktrix, Luna Cycle, Delfast
- Push legal e-bike limits
- Often have "off-road mode"

## Next Steps

### Database Population
1. Run the migration to create tables:
   ```bash
   migrate -path database/migrations -database "postgresql://..." up
   ```

2. Populate with real data from electric_bike_brands.js

### API Enhancement
1. Replace demo data with database queries
2. Add image URLs and more detailed specs
3. Implement spec submission for electrified bikes

### UI Enhancement
1. Add brand logos for electrified bikes
2. Customize spec display for electric-specific features
3. Add comparison features for power/range/price

### Data Sources
- Manufacturer websites
- EV review sites
- Electric bike forums
- User submissions

## Testing
The system is ready for testing with demo data. All navigation flows work:
1. Select Electrified type
2. Choose from 23 brands
3. Select year (2020-2025)
4. Pick model
5. View specifications

The implementation provides a solid foundation for expanding the electrified bike database.
