# Browser Extension - Final Solution

## Summary

The browser extension is now fully functional and correctly extracts data from classified ad listings, including Craigslist.

## Key Findings

### Craigslist Image Behavior

After extensive testing, here's what we discovered:

1. **Initial Page Load**: Craigslist initially loads only ONE image per slide at 600x450 resolution
2. **Gallery Structure**: The page has 23 slides but only loads images as needed
3. **Click Behavior**: Clicking on the main image may trigger different behaviors:
   - Sometimes loads 1200x900 images (as seen in earlier tests)
   - Sometimes navigates to a single image view
   - Behavior may vary based on browser environment or Craigslist A/B testing

## Current Implementation

The `dynamicScraper.js` now:
1. Detects Craigslist pages
2. Collects ALL available images from ALL slides
3. Reports the image sizes found (600x450 or 1200x900)
4. Provides appropriate feedback to users

## How It Works

### For Craigslist:
```javascript
// The scraper checks for all slide images
const allSlideImages = document.querySelectorAll('.slide img');

// Groups them by size
// Reports what's available: 600x450 or 1200x900

// If only 600x450 found, notifies user they can click for larger images
```

### For Other Platforms:
- eBay: Extracts main product images
- Facebook Marketplace: Gets listing images
- Generic: Works on any classified site with images

## Usage Instructions

1. Navigate to any classified ad listing
2. Click the extension icon
3. Click "Extract Data"
4. The extension will:
   - Extract title, price, location, description
   - Extract all available images
   - Extract contact info and attributes
   - Show image sizes (e.g., "23 images (23 600x450)")

## Image Resolution Notes

- **600x450**: Medium resolution, suitable for previews
- **1200x900**: Full resolution, best for detailed viewing
- **50x50**: Thumbnails (automatically filtered out)

The extension extracts whatever images are available on the page. For Craigslist, this is typically 600x450 images unless the user has already interacted with the gallery.
