# 99Spokes.com Scraping Project Summary

## Current Status

We've developed several approaches to scrape bicycle data from 99spokes.com:

1. **TypeScript AI-based Scraper** - Uses Stage Hands' AI capabilities
2. **Direct TypeScript Scraper** - Uses a more direct approach with Stage Hands
3. **JavaScript Scraper** - A simpler implementation using Stage Hands
4. **Puppeteer Scraper** - Uses Puppeteer for browser automation
5. **Playwright Scraper** - Uses Playwright for browser automation
6. **Axios/Cheerio Scraper** - Uses HTTP requests and HTML parsing

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Cloudflare Protection**:
   - 99spokes.com is protected by Cloudflare with JavaScript challenges
   - Direct HTTP requests receive 403 Forbidden responses
   - Browser automation attempts are detected and blocked

2. **Browser Automation Issues**:
   - Difficulty launching browsers in the current environment
   - Missing dependencies for Puppeteer and Playwright
   - Timeouts when trying to load the website

3. **Stage Hands Integration**:
   - Challenges with TypeScript type definitions
   - Difficulty accessing the Stage Hands API

## Next Steps

To successfully scrape 99spokes.com, we recommend the following approaches:

### Short-term Solutions

1. **Use a Specialized Scraping Service**:
   - Consider commercial services like ScrapingBee, Bright Data, or ZenRows
   - These services handle Cloudflare protection and JavaScript challenges

2. **Enhance Browser Automation**:
   - Implement Puppeteer-extra with Stealth plugin
   - Configure Playwright with advanced fingerprinting techniques
   - Use rotating proxies to avoid IP blocking

### Long-term Solutions

1. **Develop a Custom Cloudflare Bypass**:
   - Implement a solution that can solve JavaScript challenges
   - Use headless browsers with modified fingerprints
   - Rotate user agents, cookies, and other browser identifiers

2. **Create a Distributed Scraping System**:
   - Use multiple IPs and proxies
   - Implement rate limiting and request queuing
   - Store partial results to resume scraping after blocks

3. **Consider Alternative Data Sources**:
   - Research if 99spokes.com has an API
   - Look for partner websites or data feeds
   - Explore if the data is available through other channels

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **For Production Use**:
   - Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Set up monitoring for scraper health and success rates
   - Create a database schema for storing and updating bike data
   - Develop an API to access the scraped data

2. **For Legal Compliance**:
   - Review 99spokes.com's terms of service
   - Implement respectful scraping practices (rate limiting, identifying your scraper)
   - Consider reaching out to 99spokes.com for permission or partnership

3. **For Technical Stability**:
   - Implement comprehensive logging
   - Set up alerts for scraping failures
   - Create a dashboard to monitor scraping progress
   - Develop automated tests to verify data quality

## Conclusion

Scraping 99spokes.com is challenging due to Cloudflare protection, but not impossible with the right approach. A combination of specialized tools, proper browser fingerprinting, and respectful scraping practices would be needed for a successful implementation.

The current codebase provides a solid foundation that can be extended with more advanced techniques to overcome the protection mechanisms in place.
