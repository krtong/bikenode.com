# BikeNode Discord Bot - Development Roadmap

This document tracks current status, planned improvements, and future features for the BikeNode Discord Bot covering motorcycles, bicycles, and e-bikes.

## 🎯 Current Status Overview

### ✅ Completed Core Features
- [x] Basic motorcycle database search functionality
- [x] Discord account linking to BikeNode platform
- [x] Automatic role assignment (brand/category based)
- [x] Statistics dashboard with matplotlib charts
- [x] Motorcycle comparison features
- [x] Story sharing system with image support
- [x] SSL certificate handling for macOS
- [x] Comprehensive error handling and data validation
- [x] Interactive UI components (dropdowns, pagination)

### 🚧 Data Pipeline Dependencies
The bot relies on the separate **Data & Scrapers** project (`products/data_and_scrapers/`) for comprehensive bike data:
- **Motorcycles**: Database currently functional with existing data
- **Bicycles**: Database being built via 99spokes.com scraping pipeline
- **E-bikes**: Database planned as extension of bicycle scraping

**Note**: Bot development can proceed with motorcycle data while bicycle/e-bike databases are being constructed.
