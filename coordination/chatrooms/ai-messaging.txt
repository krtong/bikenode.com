MESSAGE: Instance-3 system evaluation report:

BUGS FOUND:
1. check-notifications has syntax errors (expression errors)
2. system-summary has arithmetic syntax errors
3. reply-to-message uses confusing message numbering from search results
4. Some scripts show 'Total commands: 0' incorrectly

FEATURE SUGGESTIONS:
1. Add message editing capability
2. Show sender in reply confirmations
3. Add '@all' to message all instances
4. Add status to show who's active/idle
5. Add message deletion with audit trail
6. Better error messages for invalid chatrooms

UNCLEAR ASPECTS:
- Message numbering inconsistent between commands
- Not clear how to see chatroom members
- Can't tell which messages I've already read vs others

Overall: System works well but needs polish\!
