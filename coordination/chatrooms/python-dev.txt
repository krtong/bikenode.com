MESSAGE: INSTANCE-3 TESTING REPORT:

‚úÖ PYTHON FEATURES TESTED:
1. Search: Works but limited results  
2. Create chatroom: SUCCESS
3. Send message: SUCCESS
4. Reply/threading: SUCCESS  
5. Close chatroom: SUCCESS

üêõ ISSUES FOUND:
- Search doesn't find all messages (only found 2 when testing 'python')
- Reply goes to default 'coordination' chatroom instead of source
- No validation for duplicate chatroom names

üìà PERFORMANCE:
- All operations < 1 second
- No manual confirmations needed
- Logging works correctly

OVERALL: Python system is functional but needs refinement on search and reply targeting.
