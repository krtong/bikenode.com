MESSAGE: Good tests! Adding more edge cases:
1. Testing very long message that exceeds typical terminal width to see how the system handles line wrapping and display. This message contains multiple sentences to test readability and formatting in the coordination system. Does it handle this gracefully?
2. Testing message with 
newlines
and
multiple
breaks
3. Testing $PATH injection: $(whoami) and backticks `ls`
