# Brand Research System

A complete automated brand research tool that uses web search to gather information about bicycle companies and formats it into structured JSON.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Claude Integration

```javascript
import { researchBrand } from './production_brand_researcher.js';

// Claude provides WebSearch function
const webSearchFunction = async (query) => {
    const results = await WebSearch({ query });
    return results.map(r => ({
        title: r.title,
        url: r.url,
        snippet: r.snippet
    }));
};

// Research any brand
const results = await researchBrand('Surly Bikes', webSearchFunction);
console.log(results.brand_data); // Complete JSON structure
```

### Command Line Usage

```bash
node production_brand_researcher.js "Brand Name"

### ✅ Quality Assessment
- Confidence scoring (0-100%) for each data category
- Overall confidence calculation
- Data quality notes and recommendations
- Source validation and cross-referencing

## 📊 Research Process

### 1. Search Strategy
The system performs 5 targeted searches:
- `"{Brand} bicycle company founding year history"`
- `"{Brand} headquarters address location"`
- `"{Brand} famous popular bike models"`
- `"{Brand} official website founders"`
- `"{Brand} parent company owner"`

### 2. Data Extraction
- **Founding Information**: Year, location, founders
- **Company Details**: Headquarters, parent company, structure
- **Products**: Famous models, specialties
- **Contact**: Website, social media, contact info
- **Business**: Employee count, revenue, structure

### 3. Quality Scoring
Each category receives a confidence score based on:
- Source reliability
- Information completeness
- Cross-source verification
- Pattern matching accuracy

## 🎯 Confidence Levels

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 80-100% | ✅ Excellent | High-quality, verified information |
| 60-79% | ⚠️ Good | Solid information with minor gaps |
| 40-59% | ❌ Limited | Basic information, needs verification |
| 0-39% | ❌ Poor | Insufficient or unreliable data |

## 📁 Output Files

Results are saved to `downloads/` directory with structure:
- `{brand-id}-brand-research-{timestamp}.json`
- Complete brand data with metadata
- Source references and confidence scores
- Research methodology documentation

## 🔧 Integration Guide

### For Claude Code Users

1. Import the production system:
```javascript
import { researchBrand } from './production_brand_researcher.js';
```

2. Create WebSearch wrapper:
```javascript
const webSearchFunction = async (query) => {
    const results = await WebSearch({ query });
    return results.map(r => ({
        title: r.title,
        url: r.url,
        snippet: r.snippet
    }));
};
```

3. Research any brand:
```javascript
const results = await researchBrand('Trek Bikes', webSearchFunction);
```

### For Custom Integration

Extend the `ProductionBrandResearcher` class:
```javascript
import { ProductionBrandResearcher } from './production_brand_researcher.js';

class CustomResearcher extends ProductionBrandResearcher {
    // Add custom data processing
    customEnrichment(brandData) {
        // Your custom logic here
        return brandData;
    }
}
```
