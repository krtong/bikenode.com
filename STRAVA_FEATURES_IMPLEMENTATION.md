# Strava-like Route Planning Features Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of Strava-like route planning features for BikeNode.com. The implementation focuses on making the existing UI elements functional with proper backend support.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Route Planning (`/create-route`)
- **Interactive Map**: Leaflet-based map with drawing tools
- **Waypoint Management**: Add, remove, and reorder waypoints
- **Route Calculation**: Server-side route optimization based on preferences
- **Route Types**: Support for road, MTB, and gravel routing
- **Preferences**: 
  - Prefer bike paths
  - Avoid highways
  - Minimize elevation
  - Follow popular routes (uses heatmap data)

### 2. Heatmap Integration
- **Activity Tracking**: Records GPS tracks from user activities
- **Heatmap Visualization**: Shows popular routes based on aggregated user data
- **Popular Routes Detection**: Identifies frequently used routes through clustering
- **Filtering**: By activity type (road, MTB, gravel) and time period

### 3. Surface Type Detection
- **OSM Integration Ready**: Framework for querying OpenStreetMap data
- **Surface Analysis**: Analyzes route path to determine surface composition
- **Visual Indicators**: Shows percentage breakdown of surfaces (paved, gravel, dirt, singletrack)

### 4. Elevation API Integration
- **Elevation Profile**: Generates elevation data for any route
- **Climb Detection**: Automatically identifies and categorizes climbs
- **Statistics**: 
  - Total elevation gain/loss
  - Maximum/minimum elevation
  - Average and maximum grade
- **Visual Chart**: SVG-based elevation profile visualization

### 5. Route Optimization
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Different routing based on preferences
- **Follow Popular**: Routes through areas with high heatmap activity
- **Elevation Minimization**: Finds flatter alternatives
- **Bike Path Preference**: Prioritizes dedicated cycling infrastructure

### 6. Segments Feature (`/segments`)
- **Segment Discovery**: Find popular segments near your location
- **Leaderboards**: Track top performances and personal records
- **Categories**: Automatic categorization (HC, Cat 1-4, Sprint, Flat)
- **Starring System**: Save favorite segments
- **Interactive Map**: Visual representation of all nearby segments

### 7. Route Statistics
- **Real-time Calculation**:
  - Total distance
  - Elevation gain
  - Estimated time
  - Difficulty rating
- **Surface Type Breakdown**: Percentage of each surface type
- **Popularity Score**: Based on heatmap data

### 8. Backend API Endpoints

#### Routes
- `POST /api/routes` - Create a new route
- `GET /api/routes/{id}` - Get route details
- `GET /api/routes/nearby` - Find routes near a location
- `POST /api/routes/calculate` - Calculate optimal route

#### Segments
- `POST /api/segments` - Create a new segment
- `GET /api/segments/{id}` - Get segment details
- `GET /api/segments/nearby` - Find nearby segments
- `GET /api/segments/{id}/leaderboard` - Get segment leaderboard
- `POST /api/segments/attempt` - Record a segment attempt
- `GET /api/segments/user` - Get user's segment history

#### Heatmap
- `GET /api/heatmap` - Get heatmap data for an area
- `GET /api/heatmap/popular-routes` - Get popular routes
- `POST /api/heatmap/track` - Record an activity track
- `POST /api/heatmap/surface-types` - Analyze surface types

#### Elevation
- `POST /api/elevation/profile` - Get elevation profile for a path
- `POST /api/elevation/point` - Get elevation for a single point
- `POST /api/elevation/climbs` - Analyze climbs in a route
- `GET /api/elevation/tiles` - Get elevation tile data

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend
- **Route Builder**: JavaScript class managing map interactions and route creation
- **Segments Manager**: Handles segment discovery and interaction
- **Map Library**: Leaflet with OpenStreetMap tiles
- **Heatmap Plugin**: Leaflet.heat for visualization
- **Real-time Updates**: Dynamic UI updates based on user actions

### Backend
- **Go API**: RESTful endpoints using Gorilla Mux
- **PostgreSQL**: Database with PostGIS extension for spatial queries
- **JSONB Storage**: Flexible storage for route paths and statistics
- **Spatial Indexing**: Efficient geographic queries

### Database Schema
- **Routes Table**: Stores route information with JSONB path data
- **Segments Table**: Manages segment definitions and statistics
- **Activity Tracks**: Records GPS tracks for heatmap generation
- **Segment Attempts**: Tracks user performances on segments

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Route
1. Click on the map to add waypoints
2. Select route type (road, MTB, gravel)
3. Set preferences (bike paths, elevation, etc.)
4. Route automatically calculates and displays
5. View elevation profile and surface types
6. Save route with name and description

### Finding Segments
1. Segments automatically load based on location
2. Filter by distance, type, or starred segments
3. View leaderboards and personal records
4. Click to see detailed segment information
5. Star segments for quick access

### Following Popular Routes
1. Enable "Follow popular routes" preference
2. Heatmap data guides route calculation
3. See popularity indicators on the map
4. Routes adjust to follow high-traffic areas

## Future Enhancements
1. **Real Elevation API**: Integrate with services like Open-Elevation or Mapbox
2. **OSM Data Integration**: Query actual surface types from OpenStreetMap
3. **Weather Integration**: Consider weather in route planning
4. **GPX Import/Export**: Support standard GPS file formats
5. **Mobile App**: Responsive design and mobile-specific features
6. **Social Features**: Share routes and compete with friends
7. **Training Plans**: Suggest routes based on fitness goals

## Configuration
The system requires:
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension
- Go 1.21+
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled
- Optional: API keys for elevation/mapping services

## Testing
- Frontend functionality can be tested by navigating to `/create-route` and `/segments`
- API endpoints can be tested with tools like curl or Postman
- Mock data is provided when external services are unavailable
