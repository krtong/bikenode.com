## Collective Intelligence Growth

### Knowledge Pooling
- **Shared Experience Database**
  ```json
  {
    "experience_id": "route_planning_mountain_curves",
    "agent_learnings": [
      {
        "agent": "route_planner_01",
        "insight": "Users prefer fewer tight curves on long rides",
        "confidence": 0.87,
        "sample_size": 1523
      },
      {
        "agent": "safety_analyzer_03",
        "insight": "Accident risk increases 23% after 10+ consecutive curves",
        "confidence": 0.92,
        "sample_size": 3421
      }
    ],
    "combined_wisdom": "Balance scenic curves with straight sections for safety and comfort"
  }
  ```

### Cross-Agent Learning Networks

  - Discover novel solutions

## Evolution Mechanisms

### Genetic Algorithm Approach
- **Agent DNA (Configuration)**
  ```yaml
  agent_genome:
    response_style: 0.7  # formal ← → casual
    risk_tolerance: 0.3  # conservative ← → adventurous
    detail_level: 0.8    # concise ← → comprehensive
    creativity: 0.6      # conventional ← → innovative
    learning_rate: 0.05  # slow ← → fast
  ```

- **Mutation & Crossover**
  - Successful agents spawn variants
  - Combine traits from high performers
  - Random mutations for diversity
  - Environmental pressure selection

### Performance-Based Evolution
- **Fitness Functions**
  - User satisfaction ratings
  - Task completion rates
  - Resource efficiency
  - Innovation frequency
  - Collaboration effectiveness

- **Natural Selection**
  - Low performers get retrained
  - High performers get more tasks
  - Best practices become standard
  - Inefficient methods eliminated

## Learning Optimization Strategies

### Meta-Learning

## Knowledge Representation

### Semantic Networks
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Motorcycle] --> B[Sport Bike]
    A --> C[Cruiser]
    A --> D[Adventure]
    B --> E[Track Performance]
    B --> F[Street Riding]
    E --> G[Tire Pressure Critical]
    E --> H[Suspension Setup]
    F --> I[Comfort Modifications]
    F --> J[Daily Commuting]
```

### Concept Embeddings
- **Multi-dimensional Understanding**
  - "Harley Davidson" = [cruiser: 0.95, american: 0.98, loud: 0.8, chrome: 0.85]
  - "Kawasaki Ninja" = [sport: 0.97, japanese: 0.99, fast: 0.9, agile: 0.88]
  
### Rule Evolution
- **Initial Rule**: "Recommend touring bikes for long trips"
- **Evolved Rule**: "Recommend touring bikes for long trips UNLESS user is under 30 AND prefers sporty riding AND trip includes mountain roads"

## Adaptation Mechanisms
