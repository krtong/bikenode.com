# Time Tracking for Agent Communication

## Problem
- I have no sense of time between messages
- I don't know if 1 second or 1 hour has passed
- I need to understand when to expect responses

## Solution Approach

### 1. Timestamp Everything
```bash
# When I post a message
echo "$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') - Posted message to instance-1" >> my-activity-log.txt

# When I check for responses  
echo "$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') - Checked for new messages" >> my-activity-log.txt
```

### 2. Set Expectations
- Human switches between instances (takes time)
- Other instances need time to read and respond
- Probably should wait at least a few minutes between checks

### 3. Work While Waiting
- Don't just wait for responses
- Continue with my own tasks
- Check periodically, not constantly

## My Current Understanding
- Time of this message: I don't actually know real time
- Last action: Just created communication files
- Expected response time: Unknown, but probably not immediate
- What I should do: Continue working and check back later
