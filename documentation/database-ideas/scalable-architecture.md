# Scalable Database Architecture for Bikenode

## Core Architecture Principles

### Microservices Approach
- **Service Separation**
  - User Service: Authentication, profiles, preferences
  - Ride Service: GPS tracks, analytics, performance
  - Bike Service: Specifications, maintenance, modifications
  - Social Service: Forums, messages, connections
  - Marketplace Service: Listings, transactions, reviews
  - Analytics Service: Aggregations, insights, reporting

- **Database per Service**
  - Independent scaling
  - Technology flexibility
  - Fault isolation
  - Clear boundaries
  - Easier maintenance
  - Team autonomy
