Iconic products include the 1A aluminum stem introduced at the 1960 Rome Olympics and the Speciale Corsa (later known as Supercorsa) road frame. In 1974, Cinelli designed an aerodynamic bike on which Ole Ritter set a new hour record. Throughout the 1970s and ’80s, Cinelli expanded into components (saddles, toe-straps) and later mountain bikes (Rampichino, 1985). Ownership passed to Antonio Colombo in 1978 and then to Gruppo S.R.L. in 1997; in August 2021, Asobi Ventures acquired Cinelli’s parent company. Today, Cinelli produces approximately 80% components (stems, bars, saddles) and 20% bicycles, continuing to collaborate with MashSF on popular fixed-gear frames.",
