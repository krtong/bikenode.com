Over the next decade, Cervélo pioneered carbon-fiber monocoque frames with the Soloist and P-series, building a reputation via pro-team sponsorships in UCI WorldTour and Ironman. In 2017, Canadian conglomerate Pon Holdings acquired Cervélo, integrating it into a global portfolio while maintaining its Vancouver R&D and manufacturing presence.",

In 1974, Cinelli designed an aerodynamic bike on which Ole Ritter set a new hour record. Throughout the 1970s and ’80s, Cinelli expanded into components (saddles, toe-straps) and later mountain bikes (Rampichino, 1985). Ownership passed to Antonio Colombo in 1978 and then to Gruppo S.R.L. in 1997; in August 2021, Asobi Ventures acquired Cinelli’s parent company. Today, Cinelli produces approximately 80% components (stems, bars, saddles) and 20% bicycles, continuing to collaborate with MashSF on popular fixed-gear frames.",

Butler’s company gained a reputation for lightweight frames featuring bronze-weld construction and ornate lugs, sponsoring international racers and competing at World Championships in Copenhagen (1931) and the Los Angeles Olympics (1932). After World War II, competition from motor transport led to financial difficulties; Claud Butler’s business failed, and its brands and trademarks were bought by Holdsworth in 1958 and later by Falcon Cycles in 1987, which continues producing bikes under the Claud Butler name.",
