4. **Document findings** below
5. **Update scout.js** with discovered selectors

## Notes

The BMW C1 is a discontinued model (2000-2002), so we rely on:
- Historical Wikipedia data
- Archive.org snapshots
- Motorcycle specification databases

All data must be scraped - no hardcoded specifications allowed.
