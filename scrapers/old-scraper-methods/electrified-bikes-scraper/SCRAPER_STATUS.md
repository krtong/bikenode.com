# Electrified Bikes Scraper - Status Report

> **⚠️ Scraper Development Principles**
> - Work with real website data and actual scraped content only
> - Don't assume website availability or structure - verify through actual scraping
> - Document real scraping results and encountered issues
> - Leave room for discovering website changes and new data sources
> - See core principles in [README_BEFORE_MAKING_ANY_PAGE.md]

npm run scrape:arctic
npm run scrape:revrides
npm run scrape:happyrun
npm run scrape:review
```

### Run All Scrapers

## Data Structure
Scraped data is saved in the following format:
```
data/
├── raw/
│   ├── segway/
│   │   └── segway-2024-01-08T10-30-00.json
│   ├── rawrr/
│   │   └── rawrr-2024-01-08T10-35-00.json
│   └── ...
├── final/
│   └── electrified-bikes-database.json
└── reports/
    └── scraping-report-2024-01-08T11-00-00.json
```

## Next Steps
1. Test the completed scrapers by running them
2. Implement scrapers for remaining brands
3. Add data validation and deduplication
4. Create cross-reference system between sources
5. Build final consolidated database

## Important Notes
- All data comes from real websites - no made-up information
- Each scraper respects rate limits (5-second delays)
- Source attribution is maintained for all data
- Manual verification recommended for scraped specs
