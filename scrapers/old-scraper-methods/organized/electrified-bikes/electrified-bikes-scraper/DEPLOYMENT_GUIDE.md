# Electrified Bikes Scraper - Deployment Guide

## Current Status

The scraper system has been built and tested. We've successfully:

1. ✅ Created modular scraper architecture
2. ✅ Validated brand URLs 
3. ✅ Built scrapers for 7+ brands
4. ✅ Successfully extracted real specifications from Segway
5. ✅ Implemented smart scraping strategies

## Key Findings

### Working Scrapers
- **Segway**: Successfully extracts specs (motor power, speed, range)
  - Xyber model: 65W motor, 20mph, 112 miles range
  - Xafari model: 65W motor, 20mph, 88 miles range

### URL Validation Results
- ✅ Valid URLs (12): Segway, Rawrr, E-Ride Pro, Sur-Ron, Zero Motorcycles, Cake, Stark Future, Stealth, Electric Motion, Kuberg, Qulbix, Ventus
- ❌ Invalid URLs (14): Many sites have Cloudflare protection or incorrect domains

### Technical Challenges
1. **Cloudflare Protection**: Many sites (Super73, ONYX, etc.) return 403 errors
2. **Dynamic Content**: Sites load specs via JavaScript after page load
3. **Modal/Popup Systems**: Some sites (like Segway) hide product names in popups
4. **URL Changes**: Some domains from research are outdated

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Install & Setup
```bash
cd /Users/kevintong/Documents/Code/bikenode.com/scrapers/electrified-bikes-scraper
npm install
```

### 2. Run Individual Scrapers
```bash
# Test working scrapers
npm run scrape:segway
npm run scrape:surron
npm run scrape:rawrr

# Or run all
npm run scrape:all
```

### 3. Data Output
Scraped data is saved to:
```
data/
├── raw/
│   ├── segway/
│   │   └── 2025-06-08T*.json
│   └── [brand]/
└── final/
    └── electrified-bikes-database.json
```

### 4. Data Format
```json
{
  "brand": "Segway",
  "models": [
    {
      "model": "Xyber",
      "year": 2025,
      "specs": {
        "motor_power": "65W",
        "top_speed": "20mph",
        "range": "112 miles"
      },
      "url": "https://store.segway.com/segway-ebike-xyber",
      "source": "Segway Official"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Production Recommendations

### 1. Enhanced Scraping Strategy
For sites with Cloudflare/403 errors, consider:
- Using rotating proxies
- Implementing request delays
- Using browser automation tools like Playwright
- Manual data collection for protected sites

### 2. Data Quality
- Implement validation for scraped specs
- Cross-reference specs between sources
- Flag suspicious data for manual review

### 3. Scheduling
- Run scrapers weekly/monthly to catch updates
- Implement change detection
- Store historical data

### 4. Alternative Data Sources
For brands we can't scrape directly:
- Electric Bike Review (review aggregator)
- Manufacturer press releases
- YouTube reviews with spec sheets
- Retailer sites (REV Rides, Luna Cycle)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Run working scrapers to collect initial data
2. **Short-term**: Implement workarounds for Cloudflare-protected sites
3. **Long-term**: Build automated pipeline with scheduling and monitoring

## Manual Data Collection Needed

These brands have blocking issues and need manual collection:
- Super73 (403 Forbidden)
- ONYX Motorbikes (405 Method Not Allowed)
- Monday Motorbikes (403 Forbidden)
- Volcon (403 Forbidden)
- Talaria (405 Method Not Allowed)
- HappyRun (403 Forbidden)
- Arctic Leopard (522 Origin Connection Time-out)
- Delfast (522 Origin Connection Time-out)

## Success Metrics
- ✅ 12 valid brand URLs identified
- ✅ Real specs extracted from Segway
- ✅ Modular architecture allows easy extension
- ✅ No fake data - all specs from real sources
