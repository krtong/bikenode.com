# Next Steps for Electrified Bikes Scraper

## Current Status
- ✅ Project structure created
- ✅ Verified sources documented (based on provided research)
- ✅ Base scraper class created with spec extraction patterns
- ✅ Example Segway scraper implemented
- ✅ Source validation tool created

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd /Users/kevintong/Documents/Code/bikenode.com/scrapers/electrified-bikes-scraper
npm install
```

### 2. Test Segway Scraper
```bash
npm run scrape:segway
# or
node scrapers/segway-scraper.js
```

### 3. Create Additional Brand Scrapers
Based on the verified sources, create scrapers for:
- Rawrr (riderawrr.com)
- E-Ride Pro (eridepro.com)
- Arctic Leopard (arcticleopard.com)
- REV Rides (retailer with multiple brands)

### 4. Manual Research Phase
Use the manual research tool to inspect sites:
```bash
npm run manual-research
```

This will open browsers for manual inspection to:
- Identify exact CSS selectors
- Note JavaScript requirements
- Document URL patterns
- Take screenshots

### 5. Build Data Pipeline
1. **Scrape each source**
2. **Save raw data** in `data/raw/`
3. **Process and normalize** specs
4. **Cross-reference** between sources
5. **Build final dataset** in `data/final/`

## Important Notes
1. **No Made-Up Data**: Only include specs found on actual websites
2. **Source Attribution**: Always track where each spec came from
3. **Conflict Resolution**: When sources disagree, note all values
4. **Manual Verification**: Spot-check scraped data against live sites
