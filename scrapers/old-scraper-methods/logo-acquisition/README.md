## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Manual Verification
- ✅ Choose vector logos over raster when possible
- ✅ Prefer official brand sources
- ✅ Ensure logo is current/official version
- ✅ Check for trademark compliance
- ❌ Avoid low-resolution images
- ❌ Skip logos with watermarks
- ❌ Don't use unofficial fan-made logos

### For Processing
- Run `--validate-only` first to check quality
- Use `--web-optimized` for web deployment
- Generate manifest for easy integration
- Keep originals in verified/ directory

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Search finds no candidates**
- Try manual search links in web interface
- Upload logo manually if found elsewhere

**Processing fails**
- Check image format and corruption
- Ensure minimum 200x200px resolution
- Verify file is not corrupted

**Web interface won't load**
- Check port 3000 is available
- Ensure dependencies are installed
- Run verification report exists

**Low success rate**
- Some brands may be historical/defunct
- Manual search often more successful
- Wikipedia may not have logos for all brands

## 📞 Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check `node logo_cli.js status` for system state
2. Review error logs in processing reports  
3. Verify all dependencies are installed
4. Check that input brand list is correct

## 🎉 Success Metrics

Expected final results:
- **719 motorcycle brands** processed
- **Multiple PNG sizes** for each brand (32px to 512px)
- **100% manual verification** for accuracy
- **Consistent format** across all logos
- **Web-ready optimization** for deployment

The system is designed to handle the full motorcycle brand database with minimal manual effort while ensuring maximum quality and accuracy.
