## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Run the working demo
node revzilla_demo.js

# This will:
# - Launch Puppeteer
# - Navigate to RevZilla
# - Extract categories
# - Save results to JSON
# - Take a screenshot
```

## 📊 Demo Results

- **Categories Found**: 10
- **Browser**: Launches successfully
- **Navigation**: Works properly
- **Screenshot**: Saved for debugging

## 🔧 Next Steps

To make the full scraper work:

1. **Update Product Selectors**
   ```javascript
   // Need to find current selectors like:
   // - article[class*="ProductCard"]
   // - [data-testid="product-tile"]
   // - div[class*="product-grid-item"]
   ```

2. **Add Dynamic Wait**
   ```javascript
   // Wait for products to load
   await page.waitForSelector('NEW_PRODUCT_SELECTOR', {
     timeout: 10000
   });
   ```

3. **Extract Product Data**
   - Product name
   - Price
   - Brand
   - Image URL
   - Product URL

## 💡 Recommendations

1. Use browser DevTools to inspect current HTML structure
2. Test selectors in browser console first
3. Add better error handling for missing elements
4. Implement retry logic for failed requests
5. Add data validation before saving

## 📝 Notes

- RevZilla uses React/dynamic content loading
- Site has Cloudflare protection but doesn't block scrapers with proper delays
- JSON-LD structured data available on product pages
- Rate limiting recommended: 2-3 seconds between requests
