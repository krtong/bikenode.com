## Summary
Checked 51 pages across all major sections of the BikeNode website. Found 7 issues that need attention.

## Issues Found

### 1. Broken CSS/JS Links (1 page)
These pages have incorrect paths in their front matter:

- **events-browse-calendar** - Had absolute paths instead of relative paths (FIXED)
  - Changed from: `/events/events-browse-calendar/styles/events-browse-calendar.css`
  - Changed to: `./styles/events-browse-calendar.css`

### 2. Missing CSS Files and Styles Directories (2 pages)
These pages are completely missing their CSS files and styles directories:

- **community-message-conversation**
  - Missing: `styles/` directory
  - Missing: CSS file link in front matter
  - Has inline JavaScript but no separate CSS styling

- **community-messages-inbox**
  - Missing: `styles/` directory  
  - Missing: CSS file link in front matter
  - Has inline JavaScript but no separate CSS styling

### 3. Inconsistent File Structure (1 page)
This page has CSS/JS files but not following the standard structure:

- **bikes-details-page**
  - Has: `bikes-details-page.css` and `bikes-details-page.js` in root directory
  - Missing: `styles/` subdirectory
  - Should move CSS to `styles/bikes-details-page.css` for consistency

## Pages with External Dependencies
These pages correctly use external CDN resources (not issues):

- **rides-activity-heatmap** - Uses Leaflet and Leaflet.heat from CDN
- **rides-create-planner** - Uses Leaflet and Leaflet Routing Machine from CDN

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions Required:**
   - Create styles directories and CSS files for community-message-conversation and community-messages-inbox
   - Add customCSS links to their front matter

2. **Consistency Improvements:**
   - Move bikes-details-page CSS to a `styles/` subdirectory
   - Update its front matter to use `./styles/bikes-details-page.css`

3. **Already Fixed:**
   - events-browse-calendar paths have been corrected to use relative paths

## Script Used
A Python script was created to systematically check all pages, handling both string and array formats for customCSS/customJS in YAML front matter, while ignoring external CDN links.
