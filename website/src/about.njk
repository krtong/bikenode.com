    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>BikeNode exists to strengthen and enhance bike communities of all types. Whether you're into road cycling, mountain biking, BMX, sport bikes, cruisers, touring, enduro, scooters, e-bikes, or e-motorcycles, we believe every bike community deserves powerful tools to connect, share, and grow together.</p>
    
    <p>We're building the bridge between individual riders and their communities, providing the technology and platform to make those connections stronger, more meaningful, and more accessible than ever before.</p>
</section>

<section class="content-section">
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>BikeNode started from a simple observation: bike communities are incredibly passionate and diverse, but often lack the tools to effectively connect and share their experiences. From local riding groups struggling with coordination to online communities wanting better member engagement, we saw an opportunity to build something better.</p>
    
    <p>What began as a Discord bot for motorcycle communities quickly evolved into a comprehensive platform serving all types of bike enthusiasts. We realized that whether someone rides a road bike, mountain bike, or motorcycle, the core needs are the same: connection, community, and the ability to share their passion with like-minded individuals.</p>

            <h3>Inclusivity First</h3>
            <p>Every bike, every rider, every community matters. We don't believe in bike type hierarchy - a BMX rider is just as valid as a touring cyclist or sport bike enthusiast.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
            <h3>Community Driven</h3>
            <p>Our features and development priorities are guided by real community needs and feedback from actual users across all bike types.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
            <h3>Privacy Focused</h3>
            <p>Your data belongs to you. We build tools that enhance communities without compromising individual privacy or selling personal information.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
            <h3>Open Collaboration</h3>
            <p>We work with existing communities rather than trying to replace them. Our tools integrate with where people already gather and connect.</p>
