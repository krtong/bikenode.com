    'Abarth': {
        'Manufacturer': 'Abarth',
        'Official_Website': 'https://www.abarth.com',
        'Status': 'Limited',
        'Country': 'Italy',
        'Years_Active': '1950-Present',
        'Last_Known_URL': 'https://www.abarth.com',
        'Notes': 'Carlo Abarth\'s scorpion-branded empire is legendary among performance enthusiasts. While famous for making Fiats into giant-killers, Abarth built incredible 125cc and 175cc motorcycles in the 1950s that dominated Italian racing circuits. The same obsession with extracting maximum performance from small engines that made their cars famous translated to motorcycles that punched way above their weight class.'

    'ABC': {
        'Manufacturer': 'ABC',
        'Official_Website': 'N/A',
        'Status': 'Defunct',
        'Country': 'United Kingdom',
        'Years_Active': '1914-1951',
        'Last_Known_URL': 'N/A',
        'Notes': 'All British (Engine) Company revolutionized motorcycle design with their radical flat-twin engine mounted transversely - a layout BMW would later make famous. Their 400cc boxer twin was so advanced for 1919 that it influenced motorcycle design for decades. Riders knew ABC for their innovative engineering and the distinctive sound of their air-cooled horizontally-opposed engines echoing through British countryside.'

        'Country': 'United Kingdom',
        'Years_Active': '1923-1933',
        'Last_Known_URL': 'N/A',
        'Notes': 'The company behind the cheeky "King Dick" motorcycle name that still makes British bikers chuckle today. Abingdon\'s irreverent naming and solid Villiers-powered machines represented the playful side of 1920s British motorcycling, when manufacturers weren\'t afraid to inject humor into their marketing. Their bikes were workmanlike steeds for working-class riders who appreciated both reliability and a good laugh.'

        'Last_Known_URL': 'https://www.acabion.com',
        'Notes': 'Swiss precision engineering meets science fiction in these enclosed motorcycles that look like they escaped from a cyberpunk movie. The GTBO can theoretically hit 375 mph, making it faster than most fighter jets. For riders who dream of the future of motorcycling, Acabion represents the ultimate fusion of motorcycle dynamics with aerospace technology - though at $1+ million, they\'re more rolling art pieces than daily riders.'

It\'s the Swiss Army knife of two-wheelers, offering motorcycle maneuverability with car-like comfort when Mother Nature turns hostile.'

        'Notes': 'German for "eagle," Adler soared through two golden eras of motorcycling history. Their pre-WWI machines were marvels of early engineering, while their post-WWII two-strokes pioneered modern lightweight design. The MB250 was revolutionary with its leading-link front suspension and pressed-steel frame. For vintage enthusiasts, finding an Adler is like discovering a piece of German engineering DNA that influenced modern motorcycle design.'
