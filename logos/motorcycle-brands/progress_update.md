## Challenges Encountered
- **Download protection**: Many logo sites block direct downloads
- **Trademark restrictions**: Major brands have strict logo usage policies
- **HTML instead of images**: Most direct URL attempts return error pages
- **Format inconsistencies**: Mix of PNG, JPEG, SVG sources

## Successful Acquisition Methods
1. ✅ **Wikipedia/Wikimedia Commons** - Most reliable for legitimate downloads
2. ✅ **Manual validation** - Essential for detecting wrong company logos
3. ✅ **Brand-specific searches** - Adding "motorcycle" context improves accuracy

## Next Priority Actions
1. **High-priority missing brands**: Norton, Royal Enfield, Vespa, Husqvarna, Zero
2. **Fix wrong downloads**: 21 brands need correct motorcycle logos
3. **Continue systematic collection**: Focus on major manufacturers first
4. **Alternative sources**: Research logo databases, manufacturer websites

## Recommended Strategy Going Forward
- Focus on Wikipedia/Commons sources (most reliable)
- Manual verification for each download
- Prioritize major/active manufacturers over historical brands
- Build relationships with manufacturer marketing departments for official logos
- Consider creating simplified logo collection for brands without available official logos

**Collection Quality: GOOD** (high accuracy after cleanup)  
**Collection Coverage: LOW** (5.6% complete, needs significant expansion)
